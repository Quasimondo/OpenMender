# OpenMender Bootstrap System

## Purpose
The bootstrap system is the self-improving framework that will ultimately build the OpenMender agent. It starts simple and grows more sophisticated through community contributions, gradually automating its own processes.

## Current State
The bootstrap system is in its initial phase. Currently, it consists of:
- Manual PR review processes
- Basic contribution guidelines
- Initial quality control criteria

## How It Works

### 1. PR Evaluation Flow

    A[New PR] --> B[Initial Checks]
    B --> C[Community Review]
    C --> D[Integration Tests]
    D --> E[Merge Decision]
```

### 2. Automation Levels
The system progresses through different levels of automation:

- **Level 0** (Current)
  - Manual PR reviews
  - Human decision-making
  - Basic checks

- **Level 1** (Next Goal)
  - Automated style checks
  - Basic test automation
  - PR template validation

- **Level 2**
  - LLM-assisted PR review
  - Automated documentation checks
  - Impact analysis

- **Level 3**
  - Semi-autonomous decision making
  - Automated fix verification
  - Self-improvement proposals

## Current Priorities
1. Establishing basic PR evaluation criteria
2. Creating initial test frameworks
3. Documenting common patterns
4. Setting up automation pipelines

## How to Contribute

### For Developers
1. Check the [Issues](../issues) labeled with `bootstrap`
2. Follow the contribution guidelines
3. Start with small, well-defined improvements
4. Include tests and documentation

### For Reviewers
1. Help establish review criteria
2. Document decision patterns
3. Validate automation rules

## Quality Guidelines
