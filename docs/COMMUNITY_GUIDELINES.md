# Community Guidelines and Impact Considerations

## Preserving Community Growth

### Why This Matters
Open source communities thrive on new contributors. Often, simple issues serve as crucial entry points for newcomers to:
- Build confidence
- Learn the contribution process
- Feel part of the community
- Develop long-term engagement

### Our Approach
OpenMender is designed to enhance, not replace, human contribution. We achieve this by:

1. **Respecting Community Tags**
   - Automatically skip issues tagged as:
     - "good first issue"
     - "first-timers-only"
     - "beginner friendly"
     - "help wanted"
   - Allow maintainers to opt out specific issue categories

2. **Time-Based Selection**
   - Focus on issues that have been open for extended periods
   - Allow maintainers to configure minimum issue age
   - Prioritize issues that might discourage rather than encourage contribution

3. **Issue Type Prioritization**
   - Focus on:
     - Security vulnerabilities
     - Performance issues
     - Dependency updates
     - Technical debt
     - Documentation typos
   - Avoid:
     - Feature implementations
     - UI/UX improvements
     - Community-engaging tasks

4. **Maintainer Controls**
   - Configurable policies per repository
   - Easy opt-out mechanisms
   - Custom issue filtering rules

## Best Practices for Maintainers

### Configuration Options
- Set minimum issue age
- Define protected issue tags
- Specify focus areas
- Configure contribution patterns

### Community Balance
- Use OpenMender for maintenance while preserving growth opportunities
- Keep a healthy ratio of AI-assisted vs. community-contributed fixes
- Regularly review and adjust policies

## Feedback and Adjustment
We actively seek feedback from maintainers and communities about:
- Impact on new contributor engagement
- Balance of automated vs. manual contributions
- Effectiveness of filtering rules
- Additional protection needs

## Contributing to These Guidelines
These guidelines are living documentation. If you have suggestions for improving our approach to preserving community growth, please:
1. Open an issue with the `community-impact` label
2. Share your experiences and insights
3. Propose additional protection mechanisms
